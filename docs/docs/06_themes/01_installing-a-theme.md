title: Installing a Theme
---

There are 2 ways to install a theme in PieCrust:

1. If you have a library of themes somewhere, you can set its root directory as
   your `site/themes_dirs` site config setting, and set `site/theme` as the name
   of the theme you want.

2. If you just have the one theme, you can make a link to it in your website
   with the `chef themes link` command.
