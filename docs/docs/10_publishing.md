title: Publishing
---

PieCrust can be used either as a static website generator or as a dynamic CMS.
This section is about using the static generation feature to publish a
completely static website. For how to deploy a PieCrust website as a dynamic
CMS, see the [deployment documentation][deploy].

At the moment, there are no publishing features included in PieCrust -- you just
run `chef bake` directly on the server, or locally and then upload the output
via (S)FTP.

More publishing features will be included in the future.
